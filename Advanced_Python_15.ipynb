    "2.\tWhat is monkey patching in Python?\n",
    "Ans: Term monkey patch refers to dynamic (or run-time) modifications of a class or module. \n",
    "     In Python, we can change the behavior of code at run-time.\n",
    "    for eg: \n",
    "        class A:\n",
    "            def func(self):\n",
    "                print (\"func() is being called\")\n",
    "                \n",
    "        import monk\n",
    "        def monkey_f(self):\n",
    "             print (\"monkey_f() is being called\")\n",
    "   \n",
    "        # replacing address of \"func\" with \"monkey_f\"\n",
    "        monk.A.func = monkey_f\n",
    "        obj = monk.A()\n",
    "        obj.func()     ## function monkey_f will be called since it is replaced..runtime chaning the behaviour\n",
    "    \n",
    "3.\tWhat is the difference between a shallow copy and deep copy?\n",
    "Ans: shallow copy: copy() -> two variables refers to same memory in case one changes other variable get updated value\n",
    "     deep copy: deepcopy() -> Diffrent memory assigned for new variable.\n",
    "    \n",

    "5.\tWhat is generator comprehension?\n",
    "Ans: using compreshsion to implement genrator for eg:\n",
    "     gen=(x*2 for x in range(10))     # () brackets to be using instead of {}-list comprehension\n",
    "     next(gen)\n"
