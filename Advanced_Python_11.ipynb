    "Q1. What is the concept of a metaclass?\n",
    "Ans: A metaclass in Python is a class of a class that defines how a class behaves.\n",
    "     A class is itself an instance of a metaclass. A class in Python defines how the instance of the class will behave.\n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "Q2. What is the best way to declare a class's metaclass?\n",
    "Ans:The method that custom metaclasses should implement is the __new__ method. \n",
    "    The arguments mentioned in the __new__  method of metaclasses reflects in the __new__ method of type class. \n",
    "    It has four positional argument,as:\n",
    "    1. The first argument is the metaclass itself.\n",
    "    2. The second argument is the class name.\n",
    "    3. The third argument is the  superclasses (in the form of tuple)\n",
    "    4. The fourth argument is the attributes of class (in the form of dictionary)\n",
    "    eg:\n",
    "        class MetaCls(type):\n",
    "            def __new__(cls, clsname, superclasses, attributedict):\n",
    "                print(\"clsname:\", clsname)\n",
    "                print(\"superclasses:\", superclasses)\n",
    "                print(\"attrdict:\", attributedict)\n",
    "                return super(MetaCls, cls).__new__(cls,clsname, superclasses, attributedict)\n",
    "\n",
    "        C = MetaCls('C', (object, ), {})\n",
    "        print(\"class type:\", type(C))\n",

    "Q3. How do class decorators overlap with metaclasses for handling classes?\n",
    "Ans:\n",
    "    A class decorator is a simple function that receives a class instance as a parameter and returns either a new class or a modified version of the original class.\n",
    "    Class decorators are useful when you want to modify every method or attribute of a class with minimal boilerplate.\n",
    "    Metaclasses can’t be composed together easily, while many class decorators can be used to extend the same class without conflicts.\n",
