    "Q4. In Python 3.X, what are the key differences between text-mode and binary-mode files?\n",
    "Ans:text-mode -> files written in user readable text characters,\n",
    "    Binary-mode -> machine/binary language \n",

    "Q5. How can you interpret a Unicode text file containing text encoded in a different encoding than your platform's default?\n",

    "Q8. How much of an effect does the change in string types in Python 3.X have on your code?\n",
    "Ans: All backslashes in raw string literals are interpreted literally. \n",
    "     for eg: '\\U' and '\\u' escapes in raw strings are not treated specially. \n",
    "     For example, r'\\u20ac' is a string of 6 characters in Python 3.0,\n",
