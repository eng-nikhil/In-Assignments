    "Q1. Is an assignment operator like += only for show? Is it possible that it would lead to faster results at the runtime?\n",
    "Ans:  += internally is in-place operation which adds right side value directly to lef side variable.\n",
    "      However, x=x+y has two operation add value of x with y and then replace x with new value.\n",
    "      Two methods should have slight performance diffrence.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q2. What is the smallest number of statements you'd have to write in most programming languages to replace the Python expression a, b = a + b, a?\n",
    "Ans: temp = a+b\n",
    "     b=a\n",
    "     a=temp\n",

    "Q3. In Python, what is the most effective way to set a list of 100 integers to 0?\n",
    "Ans: lst=[0 for x in lst]\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q4. What is the most effective way to initialise a list of 99 integers that repeats the sequence 1, 2, 3?\n",
    "    S If necessary, show step-by-step instructions on how to accomplish this.\n",
    "Ans: lst=[1,2,3]*33\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q5. If you're using IDLE to run a Python application, explain how to print a multidimensional list as efficiently?\n",
    "Ans: for i in range(len(a)) : \n",
    "        for j in range(len(a[i])) : \n",
    "            print(a[i][j], end=\" \")\n",
    "        print() \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q6. Is it possible to use list comprehension with a string? If so, how can you go about doing it?\n",
    "Ans:lst = [x for x in 'JKSDFF']\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q7. From the command line, how do you get support with a user-written Python programme? Is this possible from inside IDLE?\n",
    "Ans:using 'python' program can be executed\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q8. Functions are said to be “first-class objects” in Python but not in most other languages, such as C++ or Java. What can you do in Python with a function (callable object) that you can't do in C or C++?\n",
    "Ans: Due to below points python function is diffrent from other languages:\n",
    "        A function is an instance of the Object type.\n",
    "        we  can store the function in a variable.\n",
    "        we can pass the function as a parameter to another function.\n",
    "        we can return the function from a function.\n",
    "        we can store them in data structures such as lists.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q9. How do you distinguish between a wrapper, a wrapped feature, and a decorator?\n",
    "Ans: Wrapper is like adding extra features to existing function called decorator.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "Q10. If a function is a generator function, what does it return?\n",
    "Ans: It will return some value,may be a number.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q11. What is the one improvement that must be made to a function in order for it to become a generator function in the Python language?\n",
    "Ans: yield to be used instead of return \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q12. Identify at least one benefit of generators.\n",
    "Ans: Saving of Memory and computation power\n"
